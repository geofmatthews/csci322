\item[Description:]  I have placed an animated boids demo in the class
  repo called {\tt boids00.rkt}.  Currently it uses no explicit
  threading, tha animation loop uses busy waiting when there is no
  animation, and it uses {\tt sleep/yield} in order to collaborate
  with the GUI.

  Create two new version of this program:
  \begin{enumerate}
\item A program called {\tt boids01.rkt} that uses a single thread
  for the animation loop:  calculate forces, move the boids, refresh
  the view, sleep, repeat.  Clicking the checkbox should suspend and
  resume this thread.  There should be no busy waiting when the
  animation is suspended.  Use {\tt sleep } instead of {\tt
    sleep/yield}.

  Also, kill (not suspend) the animation thread when the window is
  closed.  You do this by augmenting the {\tt on-close} method of the
  top level {\tt frame\%}.  See my {\tt onclose.rkt} example in the
  repo.

\item A program called {\tt boids02.rkt} that uses a new thread for
  each new boid. Each thread will take care of calculating the
  forces and updating the position of its own boid.

  Every time the
  mouse is clicked, a new boid and a new thread are created. The
  threads can be kept in a separate list, or each boid object can
  contain its own thread.

  There should be one more thread that takes
  care of refreshing the view (there’s no point in each boid
  refreshing the view). Note that the view refreshing does not have to
  happen at the same frequency as the boid updating. For example,
  given enough cycles, we can update the boid positions more
  frequently than we refresh the view, to get a more accurate
  simulation.

  Clicking the checkbox suspends and resumes all of these
  threads. Again, no busy waiting and no sleep/yield.

  Also, kill all
  threads when the window is closed.
  \end{enumerate}


\item[Due date:] Friday, January 23, at
  midnight. Remember to upload both programs. Each should be stand-
  alone and run without the other. 50\% of this assignment’s grade
  points for each stage.
