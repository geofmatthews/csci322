\ti{Semantics of concurrent programs}
\bi
\ii {\bf State:} the values of all the variables at a point in time.
\ii{\bf Atomic action:} Action which indivisibly examine or change state.
\ii{\bf History or interleaving or trace:} A particular sequence of the atomic
actions of a program.  Results in a particular sequence of states:  $s_0 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow s_3
...\rightarrow s_n$
\ii{\bf Critical section:} A section that cannot be interleaved with
other actions in other processes that reference the same variables.

\newpage
\ti{Properties of concurrent programs}
\ii {\bf Property:} Something which is true of every possible history
of a program.
\bi
\ii {\bf Safety properties:}  program never enters a bad state.
Example: Mutual exclusion.
\ii {\bf Liveness properties:} program eventually enters a good
state.  Example: Eventual entry into a critical section (no deadlock).
\ei
\ii {\bf Partial correctness:}  final state is correct, assuming the
program terminates.  A safety property.
\ii {\bf Termination:}  every loop and procedure call terminates.  All
histories are finite.  A liveness property
\ii {\bf Total correctness:}  partially correct and terminates.

\ti{Assertional reasoning}
\bi
\ii Axiomatic semantics
\ii Use {\em assertions} to characterize sets of states:
\bi
\ii All states in which the assertion is true.
\ei
\ii Atomic actions are {\em predicate transformers}.
\ii Prove that bad states can't happen.
\ii Can statically analyze programs.
\ii Very difficult to use correctly.
\ii Best to combine with testing and operational reasoning.

\ti{Independence of parallel processes}
\bi
\ii {\bf Read set:}  variables read by a part of a program.
\ii {\bf Write set:}  variables written to by a part of a program (and
maybe read).
\ii Two parts are {\bf independent} if the write set of each part is
disjoint from both the read and write sets of the other part.
\ii Two parts are independent if both only read shared variables, or
each part reads different variables than the ones written into by the
other part.
\ii Which parts of the pattern finding program are independent?

\begin{verbatim}
int y = 0, z = 0;
co x = y+z; // y = 1; z = 2; oc;

\ii Final value of {\tt x} could be 0,1,2, or 3
\ii There is {\em never} a state in which {\tt y+z} is 2
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Assumptions for our machines}
\bi
\ii Values of basic types are stored in memory elements that are read
and written as atomic actions.
\ii Values are manipulated by loading into registers, operating on
them, and storing results back into memory.
\ii Each process has its own set of registers.  (Either separate
cores, dedicated registers, or a {\em context switch}.
\ii Intermediate results when a complex expression is evaluated are
stored in registers or private memory (e.g. a private stack).
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Appearance of atomicity}
\bi
\ii If evaluating expression {\tt e}, one process does not reference a
variable altered by another process, expression evaluation will appear
to be atomic.
\bi
\ii None of the values on which {\tt e} depends could change during
the evaluation
\ii No other process can see any temporary values that might be
created while the expression is evaluated
\ei
\ii If an assignment {\tt x = e} does not reference any variable
altered by another process then the assignment will appear atomic.
\ei

\newpage
\ti{At-Most-Once Property}
\bi
\ii A {\bf critical reference} in an expression is a reference to a
variable that is changed by another process.
\ii Assume a critical reference is to a simple variable.
\ii An assignment {\tt x = e} is {\bf at-most-once} if either
\bi
\ii {\tt e} contains at most one critical reference and {\tt x} is not
read by another process
\ii {\tt e} contains no critical references
\ei
\ii At most one shared variable, referenced at most one time.
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Examples}
No critical references:
\begin{verbatim}
int x = 0, y = 0;
co x = x+1; // y = y+1; oc;
\end{verbatim}
{\tt x} and {\tt y} are both 1

\vspace{1in}

One critical reference:
\begin{verbatim}
int x = 0, y = 0;
co x = y+1; // y = y+1; oc;
\end{verbatim}
{\tt x} is 1 or 2, {\tt y } is 1

\vspace{1in}

Neither satisfies at-most-once:
\begin{verbatim}
int x = 0, y = 0;
co x = y+1; // y = x+1; oc;
\end{verbatim}
Values could be 1 and 2, 2 and 1, or even 1 and 1

\newpage
\ti{The Await Statement}

\bi
\ii {\tt <await (B) S;>}
\ii {\tt B} specifies a delay condition.
\ii {\tt S} is a sequence of statements guaranteed to terminate.
\ii Atomic actions are specified by angle brakets, {\tt <} and {\tt >}
\ii Therefore {\tt B} is guaranteed to be true when execution os {\tt
  S} begins.
\ii No internal state of {\tt s} is visible to other processes.
\ii What is this?

\centerline {\tt <await (s > 0) s = s - 1;>}
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Await is very powerful}
\bi
\ii Await is convenient to use.
\ii Await is expensive to implement.
\ii Mutual exclusion:

\centerline{\tt <S;>}

\ii For example:  {\tt < x = x+1; y = y+1; > }
\ii If {\tt S} is a single assignment that is at-most-once, then {\tt <S;>}
is the same as {\tt S;}
\ii Condition synchronization:

\centerline{\tt < await (B); >}

\ii Example, delay until {\tt count > 0}:

\centerline{\tt <await (count > 0);>}

\ii If {\tt B} is at-most-once, then {\tt < await (B); >} can be
implemented as:

\centerline{\tt while (not B);}
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Atomic actions}
\bi
\ii An {\bf unconditional} atomic action is one that does not contain
a delay condition {\tt B}.
\ii A {\bf conditional} atomic action is an {\tt await} statement with
a guard {\tt B}.  
\ii If {\tt B} is false, it can only become true as the result of
actions by other processes.

\ti{Techniques for avoiding interference:  disjoint variables}
\bi
\ii {\bf Read set:} set of variables read by a process.
\ii {\bf Write set:} set of variables written to by a process.
\ii {\bf Reference set:} set of variables that appear in the
assertions of a proof of that process.
\ii If the write set of one process is disjoint from the reference set
of a second, and vice versa, the two processes cannot interfere.
\ii Example:
\ii {\tt co x := x+1; // y := y+1; oc}
\ii Both of the following are theorems:
\ii \stm{x = 0}{x := x + 1;}{x = 1}
\ii \stm{y = 0}{y := y + 1;}{y = 1}
\ii Each statement contains one assignment and two assertions, so
there are four noninterference theorems to prove, but they are all
trivial.

\newpage

\ti{Techniques for avoiding interference: weakened assertions}
\bi
\ii A {\bf weakened assertion} is one that admits more program states
than another assertion that might be true of a process in isolation.
\ii Example:
\ii
\begin{alltt}
\(\{x = 0\}\)
co 
  \(\{x = 0 \lor x = 2\}\)
  \la x := x + 1; \ra
  \(\{x = 1 \lor x = 3\}\)
//
  \(\{x = 0 \lor x = 1\}\)
  \la x := x + 2; \ra
  \(\{x = 2 \lor x = 3\}\)
oc
\(\{ x = 3 \}\)

\ti {Techniques for avoiding interference: global invariants}
\bi
\ii If $I$ is a predicate that references global variables, then $I$
is a {\bf global invariant} with respect to a set of processes if:
\begin{enumerate}
\ii $I$ is true when the processes begin, and
\ii $I$ is preserved by every assignment action.
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip
\ii Suppose $I$ is a global invariant, and every critical assertion
has the form $I \land L$, where $L$ is only about local variables,
then all processes will be interference free.
\ii Checking this is a {\em linear} process, as opposed to the {\em
  exponential } number of program histories.

\newpage
\ti {Techniques for avoiding interference: synchronization}
\bi
\ii Statements within {\tt await} statements appear indivisible to
other processes.
\ii Hence we can ignore them when considering interference, and
consider only {\em entire} sequences.
\ii For example, in the statement\\
\centerline{\tt \la x := x+1; y := y+1; \ra}
we don't have to consider each statement by itself.

\bi
\ii Many statements and parts are disjoint.
\ii Weakened assertions, e.g. {\tt buf == A[p-1]} but only when \verb|p == c+1|

\ti{Safety and Liveness Properties}

\bi
\ii {\bf Safety:}  nothing bad ever happens.
\bi 
\ii Final state is correct.
\ii Mutual exclusion.
\ii No deadlock.
\ei
\ii {\bf Liveness:}  something good eventually happens.
\bi 
\ii Program terminates 
\ii Process eventually enters critical section.
\ii A request for service will eventually be honored.
\ii A message will reach its destination.

\end{alltt}

\ii Suppose the preconditions do not interfere.
\ii Suppose {\tt pre(S1) $\land$  pre(S2) == false}.
\ii Then the two processes cannot be at these statements at the same time!
\ii {\tt false} means that the program is {\em never} in this state.
\ii In the array copy example, both processes cannot simultaneously be
delayed  in their {\tt await} statements.

\ti{Scheduling and Fairness}
\bi
\ii {\bf Fairness:}  each process gets a chance to proceed.
\ii An atomic action is {\bf eligible} if it is the next one in the
process that could be executed.
\ii A {\bf scheduling policy} determines which eligible action will be
executed next.
\ei

\ti{Scheduling and Fairness}
\bi
\ii
\begin{alltt}
bool continue = true;
co while (continue);
// continue = false;
oc
\end{alltt}

\ii If the first process always goes first, this program will never
terminate. 
\ei

\newpage

\ti{Fairness}

\bi 
\ii {\bf Unconditional fairness:}  if every unconditional atomic
action that is eligible is executed eventually.
\ii {\bf Weak fairness:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\ii it is unconditionally fair, and
\ii every conditional atomic action  that is eligible is executed
eventually, assuming that its condition becomes true and then remains
true until it is seen by the process executing the conditional atomic
action.
\end{enumerate}
\ii In other words, assuming that if {\tt \la await (B) S;\ra} is
eligible and {\tt B} becomes true, then {\tt B} remains true until
after {\tt S}.  \ii Round-robin and time slicing are weakly fair.  \ii
Not sufficient to guarantee that any eligible {\tt await} statement
eventually executes.  \ei

\newpage
\ti{Fairness}
\bi
\ii {\bf Strong fairness:}  
\begin{enumerate}
\ii it is unconditionally fair, and
\ii every conditional atomic action that is eligible is executed
eventually, assuming that its condition is infinitely often true.
\end{enumerate}
\ii Such a scheduling policy cannot happen to select an action only
when the condition is false.
\ei

\newpage
\ti{Difference between strong and weak fairness}
\begin{alltt}
bool continue = true, try = false;

co while (continue) \{try = true; try = false;\}
// \la await (try) continue = false; \ra
oc
\end{alltt}
\bi
\ii With strong fairness, this program will eventually terminate.
\ii With weak fairness, this program might not terminate, even though
{\tt try} becomes true infinitely often.
\ii It is impossible to devise a scheduler that is both practical and
strongly fair.
\newpage

\ti{Fairness in the array copy example}

\ii The example is deadlock free, even with weak fairness:
\bi
\ii When one process makes the delay condition of the other true, it
stays true until after the other process continues.
\ii Each {\tt await} statement has the form {\tt \la await(B);\ra},
and {\tt B} refers to only one variable altered by the other process.
\ii Both {\tt await} statements could be implemented with busy loops:

\centerline{{\tt \la await (p == c)\ra} $\equiv$ {\tt while (p != c)}}

\ei
\ii This program will terminate only on unconditional fairness, since
there are no more conditional atomic actions.

\ti{Livelock}
\bi
\ii If all busy waiting loops spin forever, the program is said to
suffer {\bf livelock}.
\ii The program is alive, but the processes are not going anywhere.
\ii Like two people passing each other in a hallway, each constantly
moving to the other side.
\ii Absence of livelock is a safety property.
